Fix Instructions for PDF Note Space Positioning

The issue is that when adding note space from the left or bottom, the space overlaps with the PDF content instead of pushing it to make room for the note space.

To fix this issue, you need to modify two sections in the page.tsx file:

1. In the preview generation function (around line 140-160):
   - Keep the translateContent calls for left and bottom positions
   - Move the rectangle drawing code outside the switch statement
   - Draw the rectangles after translating the content

2. In the download function (around line 270-290):
   - Keep the translateContent calls for left and bottom positions
   - Move the rectangle drawing code outside the switch statement
   - Draw the rectangles after translating the content

The key is to ensure that:
1. First, the page size is increased
2. Then, the content is translated (for left and bottom positions)
3. Finally, the colored rectangle is drawn in the correct position

This will ensure that the note space is added properly without overlapping the content.
